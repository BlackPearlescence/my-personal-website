            Koi fish are one of the incredible things that nature has to offer. 
            They look cute, they come in various colors and the ponds that people make for them
            look absolutely fascinating. This website is not Wikipedia in the sense that it doesn't
            exist to <strong>educate</strong> you about Koi fish. Rather, this website exists to express
            our love and passion for Koi fish! Think of this as a sort of <strong>Koi Fish Fan Club</strong>!
